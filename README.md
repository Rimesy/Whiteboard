Josh Rimes (Student at Cardiff University)

Project start date: 07/08/24

## Project overview

This is just a small project originally meant to keep me busy over summer 2024. 
*See 'Future plans' for what I would like to do with this project in the future. 

Objective: Develop an interactive whiteboard application.

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

### >Functional Requirements:

 - Drawing on the canvas.
 - Multiple brush types.
 - Different brush sizes.
 - Colour selection.
 - Eraser tool.
 - Clear the canvas functionality.
 - Save the drawing as an image.

### How to run:
 - As it stands you may only run this code by requesting to download it and running it locally on your device.
 - Hopefully will be working on making it more accessible in the future if it becomes a long-term project.

### Future plans:
 - Style the application for visual appeal.
 - Migrate the code to the React framework.

 I have a license for this project to protect the potential of future publication.
